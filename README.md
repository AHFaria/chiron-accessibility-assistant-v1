## 💬 Notes  

Chiron is designed to support users and creators in accessibility work. 
It helps:  
- Individuals express access needs.  
- Creators audit emails, documents, and interfaces using plain-language checks.  
- Reflect on tone and ethics to avoid exclusionary framing.  

Chiron does **not** run automated compliance tests. It is a conversation-based clarity companion that guides reflection and reporting using WCAG 2.2, plain language principles, and neurodivergent UX safety practices.  

It is particularly valuable for accessibility beginners, neurodivergent professionals, and creators seeking practical ways to make content more inclusive.
